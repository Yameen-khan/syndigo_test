            "question_summary": "I would not recommend! This set is so cheaply made. The car seat has plastic buckles that you have to hold together to click in, instead of the metal ones that can be done separately which is so much easier. Also it's so incredibly hard to Tighten or even loosen the car seat straps. The stroller wheel keeps going flat for no reason at all. It's very hard to open it up and close it just the right way so it compacts fully so it can fit into my trunk. It's so wide/thick.",
